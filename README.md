# LIQUi|>: Language-Integrated Quantum Operations

## What Is LIQUi|>?

LIQUi|> is a simulation platform developed by the QuArC team at Microsoft Research to aid in the exploration of quantum computation. 
LIQUi|> stands for “Language Integrated Quantum Operations”.  
A quantum operation is usually referred to as a unitary operator (U) applied to a column state vector (also known as a ket: |> ).
The “i” is just a constant scaling factor, hence the acronym.

#### For More Information

See the {Microsoft Research project page on LIQUi|>](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/liquid/).


### What Can I Do With It?

At a high level, you can use LIQUi|> to define quantum circuits, render them into a variety of graphical formats, and execute them
using any of a variety of simulators.

For details, see the [users' guide](Documentation/Liquid.pdf) and the [full help documentation](Documentation/index.html).
The help may also be dowloaded as a [single file](Documentation/Liquid.chm), if desired.
